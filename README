Ever wanted to change your font-size/line-height declarations from one unit to another without resorting to going back and forth between vim and an online conversion tool? This script lets you convert between px, em and % values through the use of some simple key mappings.

Mappings for converting one font-size/line-height declaration at a time include:

<leader>px - convert value to px equivalent
<leader>em - convert value to em equivalent
<leader>p% - convert value to percent equivalent

To convert all font-size and line-height declarations at the same time:

<leader>apx - convert all to px
<leader>aem - convert all to em
<leader>ap% - convert all to %

You don't have to be bound to the browser default size of 16px, which this script uses by default. To change this value, use the mapping '<leader>sd' and specify a new default size in px (i.e. 17.0). To check what this value is at any time, use the mapping '<leader>gd'.
